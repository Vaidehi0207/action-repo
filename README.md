# GitHub Action Generator (for Webhook Monitoring Project)

## Project Overview

This repository (`action-repo`) is **not** the main application itself. Instead, it serves as the designated source of GitHub events for a larger webhook monitoring project. Its primary purpose is to be the repository where typical Git development actions occur, which then trigger automated notifications (webhooks) to a separate, dedicated monitoring application.

Essentially, any code `PUSH`, `PULL_REQUEST`, or `MERGE` action performed within this repository will generate an event that gets captured and displayed by the monitoring dashboard.

## Role in the Ecosystem

This `action-repo` acts as the "subject" or "data source" for the event monitoring system. It contains no special webhook-related code itself, but it is configured on GitHub to send notifications.

It works in conjunction with the **GitHub Repository Event Monitor** application:

*   **Event Monitor Application Repository:** [Link to your webhook-repo on GitHub, e.g., `https://github.com/Vaidehi0207/webhook-repo`](https://github.com/Vaidehi0207/webhook-repo)
*   **Live Event Monitor Dashboard:** [https://github-webhook-repo.onrender.com/](https://github-webhook-repo.onrender.com/)

## How to Generate Events for Monitoring

To see activity reflected on the live Event Monitor Dashboard, you need to perform standard Git operations within *this* `action-repo`. Each of these actions, once pushed to GitHub, will trigger a webhook.

### Prerequisites:

*   This `action-repo` must have a GitHub webhook configured in its settings, pointing to the deployed monitoring application's webhook endpoint. (Refer to the `webhook-repo`'s `README.md` for detailed webhook configuration instructions).

### Steps to Generate Events:

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vaidehi0207/action-repo.git
    cd action-repo
    ```

2.  **Ensure you are on the `main` branch and updated (good practice):**
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

3.  **Perform an action (e.g., make a change, create a new file):**
    *   **Example: Add a line to `README.md`**
        ```bash
        echo "This is a new line added from a code push." >> README.md
        ```
    *   Or, create a new file:
        ```bash
        echo "print('Hello from new feature')" > new_feature.py
        ```

4.  **Stage and Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new content to README (example push event)"
    ```

5.  **Push your changes to GitHub to trigger a `PUSH` event:**
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
    *   **Observation:** Check your live Event Monitor Dashboard [https://github-webhook-repo.onrender.com/](https://github-webhook-repo.onrender.com/) after this push. You should see a "PUSH" event appear.

### To Generate `PULL_REQUEST` and `MERGE` Events:

These typically involve creating a new branch and using the GitHub UI.

1.  **Create a new feature branch and switch to it:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-new-feature
    ```

2.  **Make some changes on this new branch:**
    ```bash
    echo "This is a change for my new feature." >> feature_file.txt
    ```

3.  **Commit and push the new branch to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement new feature work for PR"
    git push -u origin my-new-feature # -u sets upstream for easier future pushes/pulls
    ```
    *   **Observation:** This will generate another "PUSH" event for the `my-new-feature` branch on your dashboard.

4.  **Go to GitHub to create a Pull Request:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to `https://github.com/Vaidehi0207/action-repo`.
    *   GitHub will usually show a prompt: "my-new-feature had recent pushes. Compare & pull request." Click on this.
    *   On the Pull Request creation page, ensure the base branch is `main` and the compare branch is `my-new-feature`.
    *   Add a title and description, then click **"Create pull request"**.
    *   **Observation:** This action on GitHub will trigger a **"PULL_REQUEST"** event on your dashboard.

5.  **Merge the Pull Request to trigger a `MERGE` event:**
    *   Still on the Pull Request page on GitHub, click the **"Merge pull request"** button.
    *   Then click **"Confirm merge"**.
    *   **Observation:** This action will trigger a **"MERGE"** event on your dashboard.

After merging, you can safely delete the `my-new-feature` branch on GitHub (using the button provided) and locally (with `git checkout main` followed by `git pull origin main` and `git branch -d my-new-feature`).
